PNGToSprites converts a PNG file to sprite data. The colors must match those in SCVPalette.png.  
  
PNGToBackground converts a PNG file to sprite data and sprite table data representing the background. The colors must match those in SCVPalette.png.  

The background can only consist of 128 sprites. This is not enough sprites to define a complete background. The rest must be left empty and filled in with either the backdrop color or semigraphic blocks.
