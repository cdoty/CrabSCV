This is an example program for the Super Cassette Vision and the uPD7801 addition to AS Macros Assembler (https://github.com/cdoty/Macro-Assembler-v1.42)  
  
Also included are two tools to convert PNG files to SCV sprites and background sprites and a sprite table.  
  
There are DOS bat files to compile and test out the software in MAME. The paths will need to be updated.  
There is also a configuration to allow compiling and running the software from within VS Code.  
The configuration depends on the bat files to handle compiling.  

The code and tools are released under your choice of MIT, CC0, or Public domain. The assembler, graphics, and tool libraries have their own licenses.
